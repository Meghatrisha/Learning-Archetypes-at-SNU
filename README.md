# Learning-Archetypes-at-SNU
Professors at SNU notice that students learn differently – some read books, some binge  series, others prefer coding. They want to design adaptive teaching strategies.  Task: Cluster students into learning archetypes.  Impact: Enables personalized mentoring approaches.
Learning Archetypes at SNU – Clustering Project
Professors at Sister Nivedita University (SNU) aim to personalize mentoring by understanding diverse student learning habits. This unsupervised learning project clusters students into learning archetypes based on:
books_read_past_year
reads_books
book_genre_top1
screen_time_movies_series_hours_per_week
binge_freq_per_week
🔍 Goal: Identify distinct learning styles (e.g., bookworms, binge-learners, hybrid learners) to inform adaptive teaching strategies.
📊 Approach:
Data cleaning & feature engineering (e.g., reading-to-screen ratio)
One-hot encoding for categorical features
KMeans clustering with Elbow Method & Silhouette Score
Visualizations for cluster interpretation
🎯 Impact: Enables faculty to tailor mentoring, course materials, and engagement strategies to student preferences.
